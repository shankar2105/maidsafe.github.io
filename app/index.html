      <p>
        Welcome to the SAFE (Secure Access For Everyone) Network, a new secure
        way to manage and control your data. The network has now reached the
        ﬁrst alpha phase of development and we are excited to let you try it out.

    <h3 class="title">A secure home for all your data</h3>
    <p class="p">
      The SAFE Network is soon to provide access to a world of exciting apps
      where the security of your data is put above all else. In time,
      downloading the free SAFE software will provide access to: messaging,
      apps, email, social networks, data storage, video conferencing, and
      much more

    <h3 class="title">Crowd sourced internet</h3>
    <p class="p">
      Rather than using data centres and servers common within today’s Internet,
       which are prone to data theft and surveillance, the SAFE Network uses
       <a href="#">advanced P2P technology</a>, that joins together the spare computing capacity
       of all SAFE users, creating a global network. You can think of SAFE as
       a crowd sourced Internet. It is on this network that everyone’s data
       and applications reside.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
      All you need to join this network is to download the free SAFE software,
      create your account and tell the network how much space you are going to
      provide. It’s that simple!
    </p>

    <h3 class="title">The service that pays you!</h3>
    <p class="p">
      By providing your unused computing resources to SAFE you will be paid
      in a network token, called <a href="#">safecoin</a>. To start earning, download the free
      SAFE software, create your account and tell the network how much space
      you are going to provide.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
      Overtime, your computer (or vault) will start to ﬁll up with network data
      and as a consequence, your virtual wallet will automatically start
      receive safecoin. You can use these to pay for other services on the
      network, or convert to another currency via an SAFE currency exchange.

    <h3 class="title">Decentralised Applications</h3>
    <p class="p">
      The ecosystem around the SAFE Network is already starting to blossom and
      a number of <a href="#">exciting apps</a>* are already being built by third party
      developers usingthe SAFE APIs.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
      Applications that provide access via the <a href="#">Launcher</a> API ensure that you
      can access all apps with the same PIN, username and password used when
      you created your SAFE account. This means that you stay in control of
      your details at all times.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
      *The projects listed within the link above are built and maintained by independent parties.
